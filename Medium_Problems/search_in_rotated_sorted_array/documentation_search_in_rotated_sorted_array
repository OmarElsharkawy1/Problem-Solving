# Function: `search`

## Description:
This function performs a binary search to find the index of a target value within a rotated sorted array. The input 'nums' represents an array that has been rotated, and the function efficiently searches for the 'target' value using a modified binary search algorithm.

## Parameters:
- `nums` (list of int): A rotated sorted array of integers.
- `target` (int): The target value to search for within the rotated array.

## Returns:
- `int`: The index of the 'target' value in 'nums'. If 'target' is not found, the function returns -1.

## Algorithm:
1. Initialize left (l) and right (r) pointers to the beginning and end of 'nums', respectively.
2. Perform binary search while 'l' is less than or equal to 'r'.
3. Calculate the middle index 'mid'.
4. Check if the 'target' value is equal to the middle element at index 'mid'.
   - If they are equal, return 'mid' as the index of the 'target'.
5. Check if the left subarray (from 'l' to 'mid') is sorted.
   - If sorted:
     - If the 'target' is greater than the middle element or less than the leftmost element, narrow the search to the right subarray.
     - Otherwise, narrow the search to the left subarray.
6. If the left subarray is not sorted, it means the right subarray is sorted.
   - If the 'target' is less than the middle element or greater than the rightmost element, narrow the search to the left subarray.
   - Otherwise, narrow the search to the right subarray.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 until 'l' is greater than 'r'.
8. If the 'target' is not found, return -1.

## Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this function is O(log(n)), where 'n' is the length of the input list 'nums'. This is because the function uses a binary search algorithm to search for the 'target'.

## Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of this function is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of additional memory to store variables regardless of the size of the input list.
