# Function: `max_product`

## Description:
This function calculates the maximum product of a subarray within an input list of integers, 'nums'. It employs a dynamic programming approach to efficiently compute the maximum product. The function maintains three variables: '_max' (maximum product found so far), 'cur_max' (current maximum product ending at the current position), and 'cur_min' (current minimum product ending at the current position).

## Parameters:
- `nums` (list of int): A list of integers representing the input array.

## Returns:
- `int`: The maximum product of a subarray within 'nums'.

## Algorithm:
1. Check if the input list 'nums' is empty. If it is, return 0, as there are no elements to calculate the product from.
2. Initialize three variables: '_max', 'cur_max', and 'cur_min' with the first element of 'nums'.
3. Iterate through 'nums' starting from the second element:
   - Store the current maximum value in 'tmp' for use in updating 'cur_min'.
   - Update 'cur_max' by taking the maximum of 'num', 'num * cur_max', and 'num * cur_min'.
   - Update 'cur_min' by taking the minimum of 'num', 'num * tmp', and 'num * cur_min'.
   - Update the overall maximum product '_max' by taking the maximum of '_max' and 'cur_max'.
4. After processing all elements in 'nums', '_max' contains the maximum product calculated.

## Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this function is O(n), where 'n' is the length of the input list 'nums'. This is because the function iterates through 'nums' once.

## Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of this function is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of additional memory to store variables regardless of the size of the input list.
