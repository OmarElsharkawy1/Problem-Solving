Approach and Algorithm:

1. Initialize two pointers, `l` and `r`, to track the leftmost and rightmost indices of the search range. Set `l` to 0 and `r` to `len(nums) - 1`.

2. Enter a while loop that continues until `l` is greater than `r`, indicating that the search range is empty.

3. Calculate the middle index `mid` as the floor division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2.

4. Compare the target value with the element at index `mid` in the `nums` list.
   - If the target is equal to the element at `mid`, return `mid` as the index where the target is found.
   - If the target is greater than the element at `mid`, update `l` to `mid + 1` to search the right half of the remaining range.
   - If the target is less than the element at `mid`, update `r` to `mid - 1` to search the left half of the remaining range.

5. If the while loop completes without finding the target, it means the target is not present in the list. In this case, return `l` as the index where the target should be inserted.

Time Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of the `searchInsert` function is O(log n), where n is the length of the input list `nums`. This is because the function performs a binary search, repeatedly dividing the search range in half until the target is found or the search range is empty.

Space Complexity Analysis:

The space complexity of the `searchInsert` function is O(1) since the space used is independent of the input size. The function only uses a constant amount of additional memory to store the pointers `l`, `r`, and `mid`.
