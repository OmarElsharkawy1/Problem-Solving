Function: plusOne(digits)

Description:
    This function takes a list of digits representing a non-negative integer and adds one to it. It performs the addition by iterating over the digits in reverse order, starting from the least significant digit. If a digit is 9, it changes it to 0 and moves to the next digit. If a digit is not 9, it increments it by 1 and returns the updated list. If all digits were 9, it adds a new leading 1 to the list.

Parameters:

    digits (list): A list of digits representing a non-negative integer.

Returns:

    list: The updated list of digits after adding one.

Approach and Algorithm:

    Iterate over the digits in reverse order from the least significant digit to the most significant digit.
    If a digit is 9, change it to 0 and move to the next digit.
    If a digit is not 9, increment it by 1 and return the updated list.
    If all digits were 9, add a new leading 1 to the list.

Time Complexity Analysis:

    The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of digits in the input list. This is because we iterate over the digits once in reverse order.

Space Complexity Analysis:

    The space complexity of this function is O(1) since it uses a constant amount of additional space, regardless of the input size.
