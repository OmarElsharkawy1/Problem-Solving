Approach and Algorithm:

1. Initialize a variable `k` to keep track of the index for inserting non-`val` elements.

2. Iterate through the list `nums` using a for loop and index variable `i`.
   - Check if the element at index `i` in `nums` is not equal to `val`.
   - If the elements are not equal, assign the element at index `i` to `nums[k]` and increment `k` by 1.

3. After iterating through the entire list, the value of `k` represents the length of the modified list.

4. Return the value of `k`, which represents the length of the modified list.

Time Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of the `removeElement` function is O(n), where n is the length of the input list `nums`. This is because the function iterates through the list once to check for `val` and perform the necessary assignments.

Space Complexity Analysis:

The space complexity of the `removeElement` function is O(1) since the space used is independent of the input size. The function operates directly on the input list `nums` without using any additional data structures.
